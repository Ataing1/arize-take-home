# Transformer Architecture

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, is a groundbreaking neural network design that revolutionized natural language processing.

## Key Components:
1. Self-Attention Mechanism
2. Multi-Head Attention
3. Position Encodings
4. Feed-Forward Networks

## Why It's Important
- Handles long-range dependencies better than RNNs
- Enables parallel processing
- Forms the foundation for models like BERT and GPT
