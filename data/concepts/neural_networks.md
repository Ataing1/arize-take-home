# Neural Networks Fundamentals

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains.

## Key Concepts:
1. Neurons and Layers
2. Activation Functions
3. Backpropagation
4. Gradient Descent

## Evolution:
- Feed-forward Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers
