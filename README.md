i'm thinking i want to build a rag that can teach me about the most notable ai research papers and their findings as well as common model architectures and their evolution like transformers, CNNs, and RNNs. 

i plan to use langchain with a CLI application. i'll probrably end up using alot of jupyter notebook to test various stages of development
